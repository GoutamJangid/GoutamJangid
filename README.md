### My Projects

Here's a couple of things I've worked on:

* **SMS Spam Classifier**: A classic NLP project to classify messages as 'spam' or 'ham'. I handled the entire pipeline from data cleaning and feature extraction to training and evaluating the final model.
* **OpenCV Image Data Collector**: A small desktop app I built to help with a facial recognition project. It used OpenCV to capture images from a webcam, zip them up, and email them to me automatically. It was a great way to learn automation and file handling in Python.
